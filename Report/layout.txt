02.- Abstract (200 words?)
 - Motivation
 - Problem statement
 - Approach
 - Results
 - Conclusions

03.- Introduction
 - Introduce relay attacks related to distance reporting.
 - Introduction to distance bounding by time of travel. Explain other methods and why
   this is the most reliable or interesting case.
     > Signal intensity
     > Ultrasound
     > Radiofrequency (our study case, extended introduction for this one)
 - Explain why faking decreased distance reports is not feasible but faking
   increased reports is (on our study case).
 - Explain why increasing the reported distance between two parties can be a
   problem.
 - Explain the theoretical attack case. Introduce and notice its difficulties
   as a practical attack.
 - Talk about other systems that are used for location (GPS, RADAR) and
   justify how we use them.
 - Present the layout of the rest of the document

04.- Previous work
 - Distance-bounding on access control systems.
 - Studies on MANETS (related to distance and cooperation protocols)

05.- Methodology
 - Explain the research done
 - How the research questions were defined
   > Justify the need for certain assumptions
   > Little explanation on the planification (?)

06.- Feasibility of the attack and interesting attack scenarios
 - Explain the assumptions made
   > Feasibility of the jamming and relaying
   > ...?
 - Present diverse attack scenarios.
   > Drones (multiple cases)
     % Cooperative working
     % Area surveillance
   > Automatically driven cars
   > Boats & harbors
   > ...?
 - For each case, state clearly the assumptions made and its limitations

07.- Fighting forged increased distance reports
 - Present the solutions
 - Multiple antenas and shared knowledge

08.- Conclusions
 - Consider the theoretical assumptions of the project
 - Given the proposed solutions, introduce and explain the implications

09.- Future work
 - Briefly talk about the need of a more practical study with real hardware
 - ...?

     and the issues that showed up during the project?)
